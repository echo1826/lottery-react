# Lottery-React

This is a single page react app that uses web3 to connect to the ethereum network through the metamask chrome extension. You must have metamask installed in your browser in order for this website to work. The operations the website allows is a lottery system where multiple people can put in over .01 ether into the lottery and the manager of the contract can decide to pick a winner and all of the contract's balance gets transferred to the winner.

## Contract
The source code for the smart-contract that this page is using is found [here](https://github.com/echo1826/smart-contract/blob/main/contracts/Lottery.sol) as well as the testing suite for that contract.
